Thank you for using GeneralizedChebsyhev.

Next to this 'readme.txt', you have received two files 'GeneralizedChebsyhev.mpl' and 'GeneralizedChebsyhevHelp.mw'.
After extraction, place both in the same folder, start Maple2022 and open the file 'GeneralizedChebsyhevHelp.mw'.
The first time, the command 'read("GeneralizedChebyshev.mpl"): with(GeneralizedChebyshev);' can return an error.
In this case, save the file, close it and open it again.

For questions, please contact 'tobias.metzlaff@inria.fr'.
