This is a Maple 2022 (https://de.maplesoft.com/products/maple/) package for computations with generalized Chebyshev polynomials associated to the simple Lie algebras.

The main purpose of this package is to produce matrices for semi-definite programs that appear in polynomial optimization [4].
Beyond that, it features several functionalities for computations with Weyl groups of simple Lie type and polynomial descriptions for the orbit space [5].

If you are specifically interested in Weyl groups acting on minuscule weights:
This is covered in a Maple 2008 worksheet by Michael Singer (https://singer.math.ncsu.edu/papers/minuscule/).



How to use this package:

Open/Create a Maple worksheet.
Download the file 'GeneralizedChebsyhev.mpl' and place a copy in the same folder as your worksheet. 
In your worksheet, type

>    read("GeneralizedChebyshev.mpl"): 
>    with(GeneralizedChebyshev);

(The first time executing this command can output an error. In this case, save and restart Maple.)

The worksheet 'GeneralizedChebsyhevHelp.mw' is a guide through the available commands of the package.



Mathematical Background:

A Euclidean reflection group W that leaves a full-dimensional lattice Omega invariant is called Weyl group.
The reflections can be defined through a crystallographic root system, which is a set of points with "nice" properties in the sense of [1,2,3].
The invariant lattice Omega is spanned by the fundamental weights omega_1...omega_n of the root system and also called weight lattice.
A theorem from multiplicative invariant theory states that those elements of the group ring Q[Omega], which are invariant under the induced action of W, form a polynomial algebra:
 
(*) Q[Omega]^W = Q[theta_{omega_1}, ..., theta_{omega_n}],

where for every weight in Omega we define the "generalized cosine"

    theta_weight := 1/|W| \sum\limits_{A \in W} e^{A weight},
    
which is simply the averaging sum over all orbit points and in particular invariant.
The property (*) allows to define the generalized Chebyshev polynomial (of the first kind) associated to a weight, namely the unique multivariate T_weight in Q[z_1, ..., z_n], such that

    T_weight(theta_{omega_1}, ..., theta_{omega_n}) = theta_weight.

(Why is it called "generalized"? Because it extends the univariate definition of Chebyshev polynomials T_k ((x+x^{-1})/2) = (x^k + x^{-k})/2.)
These polynomials form a basis of Q[z_1, ..., z_n] and are orthogonal on the orbit space of W, that is, on the basic semi-algebraic set

    TOrbSpace := { (theta_{omega_1}, ..., theta_{omega_n})(u) | u in R^n }.

Here, theta_weight becomes a function in u by setting e^{weight}(u) := exp(-2 Pi i <weight, u>).
Those are the special functions associated to root systems, that is, periodic W-invariant trigonometric polynomials, see [6] for more.
In [5], we have constructed a Hermite matrix polynomial H with the property

    TOrbSpace = { z in R^n | H(z) is positive semi-definite}.
    
The matrix entries of H are given through a closed formula that is available as a command in the package.
Alternatively, one can use a "Procesi-Schwarz-type approach", which is described in section 4 of [7], which we conjecture to be applicable for multiplicative actions in [5].

Any root system can be decomposed into irreducible components which classify the 7 families of simple Lie algebras:

    A (n>=1)    B    C (n>=2)    D (n>=4)    E (n=6,7,8)    F (n=4)    G (n=2)

Any semi-simple Lie algebra admits a root system that decomposes into orthogonal, irreducible components which are of one of the above "simple Lie types". Hence, we only need to consider the latter.
